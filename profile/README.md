Welcome to the Parkway Central High Robotics Team! We are a group of students who are passionate about robotics and engineering, and we participate in various competitions throughout the year.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to inspire and educate the next generation of engineers and innovators. We believe that everyone has the potential to make a positive impact on the world through technology and engineering, and we strive to provide our team members with the skills and resources they need to succeed in these fields.

## Our Team
Our team is composed of students from all grade levels and all walks of life. We come together to learn, build, and compete, and we value diversity, teamwork, and creativity.

## Our Competitions
We compete in a variety of robotics competitions, including FIRST Tech Challenge, VEX Robotics Competition, and FIRST Robotics Competition. These competitions challenge us to design, build, and program robots to complete various tasks and compete against other teams.
